# Vision

## DateConverter (TBD)

> Should be an easy and painless way for users to quickly edit dates in longer articles/texts to fit a different calendar.
> DateConverter aims to be a seamless, non-confusing way for users to quickly convert dates in larger texts, or simply dates to different calendars.

### Background and Problem (?)

### Users

Anyone who wishes to convert a date to another form of calendar or quickly edit a longer text to match a different calendar.

### Stake Holders(?)

## Requirements

* Users can input or upload longer text into the application. The app will automatically identify and highlight dates within the text, allowing users to convert them to their preferred calendar system with ease.

* The app should use the [TemporalConverter](https://github.com/IchanP/TemporalConverter) module to convert between calendars.
